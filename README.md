# Social-Distance-Recognition-using-OpenCV-and-Python
A very helpful and powerful python program build using OpenCV and Python, which can be used to detect whether the person walking are following social distance or not. This project is based on YOLOv3 model.

The camera is caliberated for better results. Adjust the camera angle factor for each video. Set the angle factor between 0 and 1. As the camera becomes verticle the angle factor tends to 1.

The people who are following ***SOCIAL DISTANCING*** will be highlighted by green box, the people who are at medium risk will be highlighted by orange, whereas the people who are at high risk will be highlighted by red.
